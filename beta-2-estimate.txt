(completed 11/9/15) Day 1: build all new rails models and controllers and update seeds.rb (3 hours)
(started 11/10/15) Day 2: set up new inspection application with split-view foundation (3 hours)
(started 11/10/15) Day 3: build new inspection view controller (3 hours)
Day 4: complete building new inspection view controller (3 hours)
(started 11/12/15) Day 5: build new section view controller (3 hours)
(started 11/13/15) Day 6: continue building new section view controller - add To-Dos view controller (3 hours)
(started 11/19/15 - completed 11/20/15) Day 7: continue building new section view controller - make completing a to-do run a rule (3 hours)a
Day 8: continue building new section view controller - make changing a to-do reverse a rule (3 hours)
Day 9: continue building new section view controller - build CYAs view (3 hours)
Day 10: build new issue view controller (3 hours)
Day 11: build automated switching to next section according to rhythm (3 hours)

Remaining things to do:
build rhythm section navigation
make completing a CYA work
make changing a to-do reverse a rule
make to-dos work differently based on types



Known bugs to sort out (but maybe not right away):
CYAs don't update their status on the server when completed / uncompleted

---Rhythm section navigation dev steps---

[x]  button to go back - i think the nav will be better if you could scroll through the entire list of sections.
[x]  make the section buttons link to an action
[x]  button to go forward
going back / forward loads another section
pull down rhythm for server and store in core data (probably pull this when the inspection is viewed?)
going back / forward loads the correct section
