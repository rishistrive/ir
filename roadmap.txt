Topics for discussion:

- review UI of template / report statement editing
- review front page features
- look at statement library page designs
- do we need to account for > 3 levels of sections?

- discuss development plans (see next tasks list below)

Next tasks:

Front end web UI stuff:

- add report header stuff
- add answers to report view
- add addendums
- clean up statement search editing:
	- properly default: section, statement type, list type
	- properly refresh: answers after a save

PDF stuff:

- you name it


Sometime tasks (not urgent):
- add ability to add sub sections to a template section
- add ability to reorder statements within a section's statement type
- add photo reordering
- figure out how DB should model addendums
- think about how to effectively lock down the REI 7-4 specified sections (maybe a lock flag on the template section?)
- make feedback block appear centered
- think about ramifications of allowing the editing of statements within a template - how would that affect the inspector's library of statements?
	maybe the app prompts you after a save is complete about if you want to apply this edit to the statement in your library or just save it as a new statement?
- add search results highlighting to search engine for statement library
